# acc_beluga_enrichment
The main goal of this project is to develop an enrichment device designed to encourage and monitor social behaviors in captive beluga whales. Enrichment is essential in captive environments because it provides mental stimulation, physical activity, and opportunities for animals to engage in unique behaviors and adaptations. It also offers belugas choice, control and variety in their environment, thereby enhancing their overall wellbeing. Enrichment can take many forms, including toys for play, cognitive challenges that encourage problem-solving, and sensory stimuli (sights, sounds, scents) that motivate exploration.
Research demonstrates that belugas with access to enrichment toys spend less time swimming repetitively, which is a stereotypic behavior, compared to belugas without toys. The same study notes that toys can enhance positive social interactions, like paired swimming and cooperative play, although these interactions were somewhat limited [3]. These findings suggest that thoughtfully designed toys can promote social behaviors and improve welfare for captive belugas. The study also compared the belugas interactions with seven different toys and their results indicated that belugas prefer floating toys with greater complexity, which allow for multiple play styles such as biting, catching, tossing, pulling, rubbing or carrying (In table 1, toys F, B and D were the most frequently touched toys in that order). The study also suggests that the size of a toy may be a factor, as the belugas preferred the smaller basketball (toy D) over the larger ball (toy E) because it was easier to throw around. Complex toys also support interactive play involving different body parts, including the head, pectoral fin and caudal fin. The potential for interactive play, especially with toys that could be tossed over the gate separating the pools, was also observed to be a factor in the belugas’ preferences. This type of interaction was considered a sign of increased social interaction among the whales [3]. Overall, the findings suggest that the belugas’ toy preferences are linked to their ability to engage in varied and complex play, and these insights will directly inform our design.
 The proposed enrichment device will meet the following key requirements:
Functional Requirements
The device must be a floating object capable of engaging at least one beluga in varied and complex play.
To maintain novelty and sustained interest, it will incorporate dynamic features, such as different settings or customizable elements.
It will have embedded sensors to detect and record interaction data, allowing staff to monitor engagement levels over time.
Non-Functional Requirements
The device must be completely safe for the belugas and their aquatic environment. 
It must be highly durable to withstand biting, tossing, and other vigorous interactions.
It will feature a robust, waterproof enclosure to protect all internal electronics, ensuring reliable operation with minimal maintenance. 

The effectiveness of the enrichment device will be evaluated by comparing the belugas behavior with and without access to the device. Key metrics will include the frequency of stereotypic behavior, the duration and nature of interactions with the device, and the rate of observed social behaviors, such as cooperative play. By integrating behavioral stimulation with a durable and safe design, this project aims to create a meaningful enrichment toy that measurably improves the welfare of belugas in captivity.
